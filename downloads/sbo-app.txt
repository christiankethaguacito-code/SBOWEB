SBO App download guidance

If you plan to offer an APK for direct download, follow these best-practices:

1. Hosting
- Use a reliable CDN or object storage (e.g., GitHub Releases for small APKs, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Firebase Hosting). Avoid committing large binaries to the git repository.

2. Checksum
- Provide an SHA256 checksum so users can verify integrity after download. Example:
  SHA256(sbo-app-v1.0.0.apk) = <replace-with-sha256-here>

3. Sideload instructions (Android)
- On the device, enable Install unknown apps for the browser used to download the APK.
- Open the downloaded APK and follow the prompts to install.
- Revoke unknown app permission after installation if desired.

4. Security
- Sign your APK with a release key. If distributing via Play Store, use app signing by Google Play.
- Keep versioning clear and include a changelog.

5. Size considerations
- If the APK is >100MB, consider hosting externally and offering a lightweight web install/launcher instead.

Replace the placeholder checksum above with the output of `sha256sum` or a similar tool when you have the APK ready.
